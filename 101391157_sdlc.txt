In today's fast-paced software world, being a DevOps engineer is like having the superpower of accelerating
development cycles, reducing errors, and increasing the overall quality of software.
It's not just a role; it's a critical part of the software development symphony, and mastering it can lead to
more efficient, successful, and collaborative projects.
Imagine you're building a house. Developers create the blueprints and construct the rooms (code), but DevOps
is the one who ensures that the plumbing (infrastructure) is working smoothly, the electricity (deployment) is
properly connected, and that everything is safe and efficient.
