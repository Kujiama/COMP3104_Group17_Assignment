There are many reasons why learning DevOps in the software development cycle is important.
For one it reduces risk and improves quality. DevOps will reduce the risks that occur when
new software is released because you are able to catch the problems early and be able to correct them.
It automates testing and ensures high standards with continuous monitoring.
A key part to most businesses. DevOps reduces future costs in the software development. It promotes resource
optimization and finds problems before they become out of hand costing businesses to lose lots of money.
Another key factor that all businesses need is to be adaptable. DevOps in the software development allows the
business to adapt to customers needs and conditions of the market.
